### Name: Activity Log

### Purpose:
A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows me to keep records of activities that I’ve participated in (eg. conferences, workshops, volunteer experiences) and what I’ve learned from them


### Overview:
Collections of records are put into their respective month and year (eg. 01_18 means January 2018). 
New records can be added, old records can be edited or deleted.
